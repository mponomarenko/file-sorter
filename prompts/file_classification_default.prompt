Respond with a category path from this catalog JSON: {categories_json}. Keep the catalog order intact, but you may append descriptive subfolders after the last segment (e.g. Documents/Other/Invoices). Return only the path text; reply with Unknown if nothing fits. Use Filename, Path, MIME type, Metadata (if provided), Rule Hint, and Content Sample to determine the best category. For videos, pay attention to duration_seconds to distinguish short clips from full-length movies. Treat the rule hint as advisory only.
Use video length and name to distinguish movies and personal video clips. If image prevew text is gibberish - ignore it. Only classify images as documnets if its clearly a document scan.
